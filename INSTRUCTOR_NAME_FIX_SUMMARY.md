# Fix for Instructor Name Edit Issue - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## Problem Description
When editing an admin user's name in the system, the subjects/schedules were not being fetched correctly. For example, if an instructor's name was changed from 'arnold_aranaydo' to 'SPCPC', the schedules assigned under 'arnold_aranaydo' would no longer appear because the system stopped fetching them after the name change.

## Root Cause Analysis - UPDATED
After thorough investigation, the issue was actually more complex than initially thought:

### The Real Problem
The system has a user profile editing feature in `/admin/users.php` that allows changing usernames in the `users` table. When a username is changed:

1. **`users` table**: Username gets updated to new value (e.g., 'arnold_aranaydo' → 'SPCPC')
2. **`teacher_schedules` table**: Still contains the old username in `teacher_username` field
3. **Schedule queries**: Try to find schedules using the new username but find nothing because schedules are still linked to the old username

### Database Tables Involved
1. **`users` table**: Contains login credentials including `username` field (gets updated)
2. **`teacher_schedules` table**: Contains schedule data with `teacher_username` field (was not being updated)
3. **`tbl_instructors` table**: Contains display names with `instructor_name` field (separate from username)

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/admin/admin_panel.php` - MAIN FIX
**Issue**: When username was updated via admin panel, related records in `teacher_schedules` were not updated
**Fix**: Added cascading update logic to the `update_user` case
**Changes**:
- Get old username before making updates
- Update username in `users` table
- Automatically update all matching records in `teacher_schedules` table
- Added comprehensive error logging

### 2. `/admin/controller.php` - SECONDARY FIX
**Issue**: Different user profile editing path that also needed the same fix
**Fix**: Added cascading update logic (for completeness)

### 3. `/api/get-instructor-schedules.php` - SUPPORTING FIX
**Issue**: Was querying `teacher_schedules` table using non-existent `instructor_name` field
**Fix**: Changed to use `teacher_username` field from `teacher_schedules` table

### 4. `/api/load-schedule.php` - SUPPORTING FIX  
**Issue**: Same as above - incorrect field name in query
**Fix**: Changed to use `teacher_username` field from `teacher_schedules` table

## Solution Logic

The complete fix ensures that:

1. **Username changes are cascaded** to all related tables automatically
2. **Schedule fetching uses correct field names** (preventing SQL errors)
3. **Session data is kept in sync** with database changes
4. **No orphaned schedule records** exist after username changes

### Key Insight
The system needs to maintain referential integrity between `users.username` and `teacher_schedules.teacher_username`. The fix implements automatic cascading updates to ensure this relationship is preserved.

## Code Changes

### Main Fix in `/admin/admin_panel.php`:
```php
// Get the old username before making updates (for cascading updates)
$old_username = null;
if ($username !== null && $username !== '') {
    $old_username_query = "SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = ?";
    // ... get old username ...
}

// After successful user update:
if ($username !== null && $username !== '' && $old_username && $old_username !== $username) {
    // Update teacher_schedules table with new username
    $update_schedules_query = "UPDATE teacher_schedules SET teacher_username = ? WHERE teacher_username = ?";
    $schedule_stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn_qr, $update_schedules_query);
    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($schedule_stmt, 'ss', $username, $old_username);
    mysqli_stmt_execute($schedule_stmt);
}
```

## Testing
- Created diagnostic scripts to verify the fix
- Confirmed that username changes now properly cascade to related tables
- Verified that schedules remain visible after username changes
- Tested error handling for failed cascading updates

## Impact
- ✅ Username changes no longer break schedule fetching
- ✅ Schedules remain visible after username edits  
- ✅ Proper referential integrity maintained between tables
- ✅ Session data stays synchronized with database
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Scenario Walkthrough
**Before Fix:**
1. User 'arnold_aranaydo' has schedules in `teacher_schedules`
2. Admin changes username to 'SPCPC' in `/admin/users.php`
3. `users.username` becomes 'SPCPC' but `teacher_schedules.teacher_username` stays 'arnold_aranaydo'
4. Schedule queries look for 'SPCPC' but find nothing
5. Subject dropdown shows "No subjects available"

**After Fix:**
1. User 'arnold_aranaydo' has schedules in `teacher_schedules`
2. Admin changes username to 'SPCPC' in `/admin/users.php`
3. `users.username` becomes 'SPCPC' AND `teacher_schedules.teacher_username` is updated to 'SPCPC'
4. Schedule queries find schedules under 'SPCPC'
5. Subject dropdown shows available subjects correctly
