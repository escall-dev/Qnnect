# Database files
# NOTE: Previously all .sql files were ignored. Commented out to allow committing selected SQL schema/data.
# If you only want to allow specific directories, you can keep the global ignore and add negation patterns.
# Example (uncomment to revert and keep only admin/main_databases tracked):
# *.sql
# !admin/main_databases/*.sql
*.db

# Configuration files with sensitive data
config.php
database.php
conn.php
