# Data Isolation Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Description
Attendance data was visible across different user accounts within the same school. For example, attendance logs of students under Instructor A in SPCPC were also appearing in the account of Instructor B from the same school.

## Root Cause Analysis
Several PHP files were only filtering attendance data by `school_id` but not by `user_id`, allowing instructors from the same school to see each other's attendance records.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `api/get-attendance-list.php`
**Problem**: Main attendance query only filtered by `school_id`
**Fix**: Added `user_id` filter to both the main query and total count query

**Before**:
```sql
WHERE a.time_in IS NOT NULL AND a.school_id = ?
```

**After**:
```sql
WHERE a.time_in IS NOT NULL AND a.school_id = ? AND a.user_id = ?
```

### 2. `print-attendance.php`
**Problem**: Main attendance query missing both `school_id` and `user_id` filters
**Fix**: Added both filters to the main attendance query and updated parameter binding

**Before**:
```sql
WHERE time_in IS NOT NULL
```

**After**:
```sql
WHERE time_in IS NOT NULL AND tbl_attendance.school_id = :school_id AND tbl_attendance.user_id = :user_id
```

### 3. `index.php`
**Problem**: Attendance display query only filtered by `school_id`
**Fix**: Added `user_id` filter to both the main query and pagination count query

**Before**:
```sql
WHERE a.time_in IS NOT NULL AND a.school_id = ?
```

**After**:
```sql
WHERE a.time_in IS NOT NULL AND a.school_id = ? AND a.user_id = ?
```

## Files Already Correctly Implemented
The following files were already properly filtering by both `school_id` and `user_id`:

- `attendance_status.php` - ✅ Correct filtering
- `attendance-grades.php` - ✅ Correct filtering  
- `dashboard.php` - ✅ Correct filtering
- `export_attendance.php` - ✅ Correct filtering
- `export_status_report.php` - ✅ Correct filtering

## Testing
Created `test_data_isolation.php` script to verify data isolation is working correctly.

## Security Implications
- **Before**: Instructors could see attendance records of students not assigned to them
- **After**: Each instructor can only see attendance records of their own students
- **Impact**: Maintains data privacy and compliance with user access controls

## Best Practices Implemented
1. Always filter by both `school_id` AND `user_id` in attendance queries
2. Consistent parameter binding to prevent SQL injection
3. Proper session validation before data access
4. Added comments explaining the data isolation requirements

## Verification Steps
1. Run `test_data_isolation.php` to check data isolation
2. Login as different instructors from the same school
3. Verify each can only see their own attendance data
4. Check API endpoints return filtered results
5. Verify print and export functions respect user boundaries

## Notes
- The `includes/school_branding.php` file was intentionally left unchanged as it provides school-wide statistics for dashboard purposes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Error handling and logging remain intact
